The two-dimensional bin packing problem is concerned with the optimal containment of some number of smaller rectangles within a large boundary rectangle. This problem is just one sub-classification of the knapsack problem, which is concerned with maximizing the value of items in a one-dimensional container. Herein the problem is defined to be a 2D knapsack problem with no rotation where the containment bound is a large rectangle, where the sub-items to be packed are smaller rectangles and all lengths are integer; the objective is to find the best container for all objects which minimizes the difference between the length and width of the boundary rectangle. Other authors in this field consider variations where each sub-item can be assigned a weight independent of its area and for sub-item rotation, which add complexity but remain similar to the aforementioned problem statement. Although the two-dimensional bin packing problem has no general solution, there are several approaches that have been devised and published - guillotine cuts, where the containment boundary is subdivided into yet smaller rectangles; integer linear programming, a type of mathematical optimization problem that attempts to define the packing problem in terms of an object problem and constraints; and binary tree corner searching, where sub-items attempt to be placed at corners (either to the right or below) where space is available. The binary tree corner search approach is the most widely cited and is used for the defined problem.
