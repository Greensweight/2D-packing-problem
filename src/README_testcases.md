test1 - test7 are run by default  when running the code for optimal packing.

Each line contains a BoxID Height Width, all integer, separated by comma
1,H,W
2,H,W
3,H,W

Testcases with an underscore (i.e. _1, _10, etc.) were used to test performance of the algorithm
running only a single test case at a time and print statements removed. They are not
run by default but remain here for reference.
